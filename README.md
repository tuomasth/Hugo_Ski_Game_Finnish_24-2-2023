# Hugo_Ski_Game_Finnish_24-2-2023
Java skiing game - Hugo the Troll fan game - I do not own the Hugo franchise - support the official releases! 

Recommended Java: newer than "jre-8u361" & "jdk-18.0.2.1". JVM does matter. If the game will not start up, install JDK.

Having a possible laptop charging cable plugged in is highly recommended. The battery status affects the game on some laptop PCs. The folders "lib" and "src" are important.

The game is only in Finnish. Google Drive has JRE+JDK (for Windows) and also the original MP4 cutscenes available:
