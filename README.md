---

- Holding down Enter at some points creates multiple game instances and the game will be messed up
- With some PCs, the game is slower than usual and it slows down even more as you play (problem with freeing memory even when the garbage collector is called?)
- The video gifs are too large and they might still flicker and the sounds are a bit misplaced, the game is missing the actual (mp4) video support
- Removing a laptop's charging cable causes some graphic threads to slow down a bit
- The 3rd ski track from left (2 when 0-3) is missing a limit of moving the object too far to the right, sometimes the object gets on the 4th track (3)
- The 4 movable objects on the tracks sometimes flash on the screen for a very short time before they are set correctly
- There's no "real" hit detection with x-y-coordinates, game speed "prediction" is not 100% correct, sometimes the player thinks about getting the money even when it is not possible anymore
- It is possible to get stuck in between tracks 3 & 4 (the last two 2 & 3) with pressing left+right at the same time, however, pressing left gets you out of stuck
- Having to press Enter all the time after every video can be annoying, automatic proceeding would be nice
- The window size (resolution) cannot be resized, would be nice to play on full screen mode
