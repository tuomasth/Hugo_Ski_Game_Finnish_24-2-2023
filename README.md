# Hugo_Ski_Game_Finnish_24-2-2023
Java skiing game - Hugo the Troll fan game - I do not own the Hugo franchise - support the official releases! 

Newest version: 1.0.0.4 on Nov-8-2023 

Recommended Java: "jdk-18.0.2.1" or newer. JVM does matter. If the game does not start up, you have to install JDK and make sure the Operating System is not blocking Java.

Having a possible laptop charging cable plugged in is highly recommended. The battery status affects the game on some laptop PCs. The folders "lib" and "src" are important.

The game is only in Finnish. Google Drive has the JDK (for Windows x64) and also the original MP4 cutscenes available:

No matter what GitHub informs you, this is made 100 %:tly with the Java programming language. "Shell" and "Html" probably come from the "Java Media Framework" library that has been used. Also, for some reason some people think this is an old Java Mobile Phone game. That is just wrong! Those were used in about 2000-2009 and I am not interested in developing old cell phone applications! Java is a programming language by Oracle / Sun Microsystems.

Ohjeet: 
1. Asenna uusin JDK.
2. Code-nappi -> download ZIP. 
3. Pura Zip-paketin tiedostot haluamaasi kansioon. 
4. Peli käynnistyy kaksoisklikkaamalla tiedostoa "HugoHiihto.jar". Tiedosto "run.bat" ajaa saman asian komennollaan "java -jar HugoHiihto.jar". Käyttöjärjestelmä voi varoittaa, ettei tuntemattomia exe/bat-tiedostoja kuulu käynnistää. 

Instructions: 
1. Install the newest JDK.
2. Choose the Code button -> download ZIP. 
3. Extract the Zip to a folder you want. 
4. Double-click "HugoHiihto.jar" and the game should start up. The file "run.bat" has the command "java -jar HugoHiihto.jar". The Operating System might warn you of executing unknown exe and bat files.
